## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-17

### Removed

- **Legacy Node application stack (759 files, -322k lines).** The production
  stack is 100% Rust: the `blitzkrieg-core` engine and the Polymarket
  extension plugin are spawned and supervised by `ui_kit_web`, which also
  serves the Vue panel and its API. The legacy Node gateway (agents,
  channels, feeds, execution, strategies, skills, MCP, …) had no running
  consumers. `src/` shrinks to the 5-file IPC verification layer used by
  the `core:*` / `account:*` acceptance gates.
- Legacy tests (22 → 2, both covering the IPC socket contract), legacy
  scripts, npm publish config, and the npm dependency tree (~60 → 4 runtime
  deps: pino, pino-pretty, ws, zod; `node_modules` 46 MB).
- Docs describing the deleted Node subsystems (API, architecture, skills,
  ACP, bittensor, EVM wallet, telemetry, security audit of the old stack, …).

### Changed

- License copyright line moves to `BlitzkriegBot contributors (ceer-quant)`.
- `docs/` reorganized: Rust system documentation stays public
  (`docs/`, `docs/rust-core/`); internal development working documents move
  to `dev-docs/` (not published).

### Verified

- `tsc` clean; 11/11 node tests; build clean; secret-scan clean.
- `cargo test --lib`: 232/232.
- Acceptance gates: shutdown-cleanliness, parent-monitor, readonly-egress
  all PASS against the rebuilt core.
